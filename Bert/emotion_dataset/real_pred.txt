Life is too short to be serious all the time. So if you can’t laugh at yourself, call me I will laugh at you;joy
I love my six packs so much; I protect it with a layer of fat.;joy
Life is beautiful… from Friday to Monday.;joy
Every time You smile I smile.;joy
One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.;joy
My phone screen is brighter than my future; anger
Don’t disturb me, I am disturbed enough already.;anger
People are selfish now a days.;anger
I am who I am, your approval isn't needed.;anger
If you dont want me , Dont fuck with my feelings.;anger
Seven billion people on this planet and I have 2 friends;sadness
To the less fortunate… life is nothing but a tragedy;sadness
Never become a daughter of a house where there’s no mother 🙁;sadness
